*Project Idea:


I decided to create an application that had the possibility of expansion for POS intergration or inventory management. I was inspired by work because after a long
day, nothing beats a tasty cocktail. This application would be useful if someone is interested in having an online drink data base which gives you the ability to 
filter by the glass or ingrediants, and also shows a list of popular drinks. This could also be a great tool for a new bartender to reference when learning new drinks
or making drinks they are unfamiliar with the process to make it and ingrediants involved. The application is called Cocktail Central, and I had fun learning Winforms, 
creating logos, and connecting the functionality with code, and accessing the data by making http request and parsing json files. 



****This was my original idea
For my final project I'm thinking about writing a program using WinForms where it will let a user input a file name, and gives them the option to see how different
algorthims affect their run time of their file. They can pick one of the algorithims that will show statistics like the run time, and the 
computational complexity. Additionally, if they choose all the alogorthims, it will return some sort of comparative visualization.I'm thinking the algorthims I want to chose
will include Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. This is not definitive, but I feel like it will give me a good feel. I was inspired to do this as my project because 
I had an aha moment in CS 243 where we had to count the set of instructions, come up with an equation, and look at the improvements with just a few modifications to the code. I feel like this 
really gave me a strong understanding because we ended up with a 0(1) runtime because the input was independent of the number of instructions which was 9 (a constant). While this is not really relating 
to personal interest persay, it will be a cool application to get quick statistical information.
