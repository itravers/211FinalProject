*Project Idea:


For my final project I'm thinking about writing a program using WinForms where it will let a user input a file name, and gives them the option to see how different
algorthims affect their run time of their file. They can pick one of the algorithims that will show statistics like the run time, and the 
computational complexity. Additionally, if they choose all the alogorthims, it will return some sort of comparative visualization.I'm thinking the algorthims I want to chose
will include Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. This is not definitive, but I feel like it will give me a good feel. I was inspired to do this as my project because 
I had an aha moment in CS 243 where we had to count the set of instructions, come up with an equation, and look at the improvements with just a few modifications to the code. I feel like this 
really gave me a strong understanding because we ended up with a 0(1) runtime because the input was independent of the number of instructions which was 9 (a constant). While this is not really relating 
to personal interest persay, it will be a cool application to get quick statistical information.
