I went over different ideas of brain storming for my project. I realized that I do not have enough time to get into some too fancy due to the fact that I was out for a week
for health reasons, but I was exploring how I could morph Milestone 5 into a project that could include a social network. I thought it would be fun to see who had higher weight in 
society and how that relates to the other nodes and relationship. I started to thinnk more about how I could relate this to work or something I'm interested in for networking, and 
I really liked the fact that I could morph the ideas from the project 5 using Dikjstra's alogrithm to something that I had interest in which was computer networking. I decided to 
make a graphical representation of the OSPF protocol that could be used in an education environment. These types of visual tools were helpful when I was taking my classes at CR, and
I feel that Cisco did a great job with that aspect of the learning portal. I used paper to plant my thoughts about design, and came up with a few different ideas that I would have to consider. 
The first one is the UI. I thought about the individual steps like click on the router, user clicks on an additional router, and calculates the shortest path. I was thinking in terms of how 
the phone line could be a more direct connection, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is the shortest path available to them. I thought about how I could animate a packet coming down the wires, 
and refreshing myself on the different tools that are avialble in Unity. I have been using a variaty of YouTube videos to assist me with the basic functionality.

I completely scratched my program because I felt the functionality would be too simple, and it wasn't keeping me engaged. Instead I started looking for practical applications I would use, or I thought would be fun, engaging, and useful. I came up 
with the idea of an application that has the ability to filter drinks, by specific fields. I started looking at different libraries I could use to be able to interface with the API. I hunkered down and learned about Windforms, and surprisingly it has
a great ability to interface with Visual Sudio, and the results are much more immediate. I started designing on paper, and it took me approximatley 3 hours to work on design alone. I didn't want to rush to coding even though I feel like I'm behind in terms
of where I should be with progress. At this point in my desing process, I need to work through an algorithim that uses sets of data and finds the intersection of them. I figured arrays were the best data structure to use, so I'm working on how that will
look programatically. I have the GUI desgined, and I'm feeling much better about my project. I didn't want to loose hope because I was suffering with the creativity piece of this project. Much like writers block, I felt like I had designers block. Now that
the ball is rolling, and I feel more familiar with Windforms itself. I feel less intimidated about the work ahead of me in the next few days. I plan to do the meat and potatoes of the programming in the next few days, as I learn more about how the intergration
of the libraries will take place.
