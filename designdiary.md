I went over different ideas of brain storming for my project. I realized that I do not have enough time to get into some too fancy due to the fact that I was out for a week
for health reasons, but I was exploring how I could morph Milestone 5 into a project that could include a social network. I thought it would be fun to see who had higher weight in 
society and how that relates to the other nodes and relationship. I started to thinnk more about how I could relate this to work or something I'm interested in for networking, and 
I really liked the fact that I could morph the ideas from the project 5 using Dikjstra's alogrithm to something that I had interest in which was computer networking. I decided to 
make a graphical representation of the OSPF protocol that could be used in an education environment. These types of visual tools were helpful when I was taking my classes at CR, and
I feel that Cisco did a great job with that aspect of the learning portal. I used paper to plant my thoughts about design, and came up with a few different ideas that I would have to consider. 
The first one is the UI. I thought about the individual steps like click on the router, user clicks on an additional router, and calculates the shortest path. I was thinking in terms of how 
the phone line could be a more direct connection, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is the shortest path available to them. I thought about how I could animate a packet coming down the wires, 
and refreshing myself on the different tools that are avialble in Unity. I have been using a variaty of YouTube videos to assist me with the basic functionality.

I completely scratched my program because I felt the functionality would be too simple, and it wasn't keeping me engaged. Instead I started looking for practical applications I would use, or I thought would be fun, engaging, and useful. I came up 
with the idea of an application that has the ability to filter drinks, by specific fields. I started looking at different libraries I could use to be able to interface with the API. I hunkered down and learned about Windforms, and surprisingly it has
a great ability to interface with Visual Sudio, and the results are much more immediate. I started designing on paper, and it took me approximatley 3 hours to work on design alone. I didn't want to rush to coding even though I feel like I'm behind in terms
of where I should be with progress. At this point in my desing process, I need to work through an algorithim that uses sets of data and finds the intersection of them. I figured arrays were the best data structure to use, so I'm working on how that will
look programatically. I have the GUI desgined, and I'm feeling much better about my project. I didn't want to loose hope because I was suffering with the creativity piece of this project. Much like writers block, I felt like I had designers block. Now that
the ball is rolling, and I feel more familiar with Windforms itself. I feel less intimidated about the work ahead of me in the next few days. I plan to do the meat and potatoes of the programming in the next few days, as I learn more about how the intergration
of the libraries will take place.

I have made so much progress in my Cocktail Central app, and I'm extremely proud of myself and really excited to see my final product. Today I worked on the true functionality of my code and getting the different parts connected together. 
Before I started coding, I was thinking of what data structure would be best for what I was trying to accomplish. The goal is to click on a drop down menu, and via an HTTP request, populate the information through a json file from the API. 
I thought an associative array would be best because I thought 2 D associative array would have been best because I thought it would be good to refer to the drink, and have the output. Dictionaries and associates arrays that I learned in CS 328 
seemed like a good fit, and given that I'm working on my own web page in Sharon's class, I wanted to see how it would translate in this class. When the 2 D array did not produce the output that I wanted, I tried a one demential array, and I think  
it will be easier to load from the json files. I learned about $_POST and $_GET in Sharon's class as well as json, so it's awesome that I'm able to put the skills that I have picked up in that class, and apply it to this project. I realized I was too 
focused on the data structure piece instead of just enjoying myself and having fun. This project, by far, has been the most rewarding experience since I began learning programming. I really suggest using Winforms or atleast introduce it because it really
helped keep me engaged because I could see the immidiate changes without having to spend tons of hours in Unity trying to figure out how to even load the game. I plan to get help figuring out the json library issue which I need to be able to appropriatley 
parse my data, and it put it into a readable format.

Today I was able to imlement all of the final touches. At the beginning of the day I had the programmed designed and I had the GUI set-up for the most part, but I had a bunch of stub functions I needed to complete, and HTTP
requests that I needed to connect to pull my desired json file, and get it parsed. The parsing issue was resolved with a help of a friend, and I' was able use that function outline several times. I built my intersection function
that took the drop down menu I created with the desired ingrediant type and the desired glass type. I also added a search function, but I wasn't able to get a shadow input box set up for the text. I got my list sorted in 
alphabetical order in both drop down menus, and I have 5 favorite drink pictures on the top of my application, and when you click on the picture it gathers the information about the drink via the http request. I had to add
variables for each of the ingrediants, so in therory if there are more than 6 ingrediants, it will only display the first 6. This was mainly for sizing and the real estae avaible on the GUI. I had some failures in getting
my search bar to correctly filter with the other two drop down features, but functionality wise and the two intersection searches, I feel good about. This was probably the most rewarding programming so far, and I'm really
glad I was able to get over the 'project idea' hump. I put ALOT of hours into this project, and I'm excited to see how I do.
