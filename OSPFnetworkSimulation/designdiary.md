I went over different ideas of brain storming for my project. I realized that I do not have enough time to get into some too fancy due to the fact that I was out for a week
for health reasons, but I was exploring how I could morph Milestone 5 into a project that could include a social network. I thought it would be fun to see who had higher weight in 
society and how that relates to the other nodes and relationship. I started to thinnk more about how I could relate this to work or something I'm interested in for networking, and 
I really liked the fact that I could morph the ideas from the project 5 using Dikjstra's alogrithm to something that I had interest in which was computer networking. I decided to 
make a graphical representation of the OSPF protocol that could be used in an education environment. These types of visual tools were helpful when I was taking my classes at CR, and
I feel that Cisco did a great job with that aspect of the learning portal. I used paper to plant my thoughts about design, and came up with a few different ideas that I would have to consider. 
The first one is the UI. I thought about the individual steps like click on the router, user clicks on an additional router, and calculates the shortest path. I was thinking in terms of how 
the phone line could be a more direct connection, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is the shortest path available to them. I thought about how I could animate a packet coming down the wires, 
and refreshing myself on the different tools that are avialble in Unity. I have been using a variaty of YouTube videos to assist me with the basic functionality.
